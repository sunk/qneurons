# $q$-Neurons: Neuron Activations based on Stochastic Jackson's Derivative Operators

An application of quantum calculus [1] in deep learning and an extension of our technical report [2]. A $q$-neuron is a stochastic neuron with its activation function relying on Jackson's discrete $q$-derivative for a stochastic parameter $q$.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6.x
- keras-2.2.x
- tensorflow-1.1x

## Run the code

```bash
python runqact.py <mnist|cifar-10|cifar-100> <mlp|cnn|siamese|ae|resnet> <elu|qelu|nelu>
```
where ```elu``` means Exponential Linear Units, ```qelu``` means its corresponding q-activation, and ```nelu``` means gradient noise injection [3]. See
```bash
python runqact.py --help
```
for more configuration options.

To repeat our reported results, see the scripts in the ```hpc``` directory.
